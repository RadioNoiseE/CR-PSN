\begin{frame}{The Challenge}
  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) is an international contest for high school students and college undergraduates.
  The contest challenge teams of up to three students to analyze, model, solve, and present solution reports to an open-ended application problem.
  In this contest research, analytics, and applied intelligence are just as important as time management and problem selection.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem Choices}
  Contest teams of up to three students address one of the following three problem choices over the period of the contest weekend.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item MCM Problem A (continuous)
    \item MCM Problem B (discrete)
    \item MCM Problem C (data insights)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's in it for you?}
  This contest provides a challenge to solve a real-world application problem, and get recognition for it on an international stage.
  It's an excellent opportunity to develop your interpersonal skills through teamwork, develop technical writing and communication skills through your written report,
  feel a sense of accomplishment, and earn an impressive resume credential.
  Students and advisors report that participation and success in MCM provides an advantage when applying for internships and jobs.
